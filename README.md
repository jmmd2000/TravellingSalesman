# TravellingSalesman
The final project for CS211 (Algorithms and Data Structures 2) in the 2nd year of the course was to tackle the Travelling Salesman problem. This took in a preformatted set of data including, among other things, GPS coordinates, the address, the amount of time they had been waiting, and a few other pieces of information. Customers are happy to wait up to 30 minutes for their pizza, each minute more becomes an "angry minute". We were tasked with finding the fastest route between the houses while keeping the amount of angry minutes to a minimum.
